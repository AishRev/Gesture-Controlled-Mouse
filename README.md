## Gesture Mouse Control using OpenCV & MediaPipe
This project enables hands-free control of your mouse using simple hand gestures via webcam input. It uses real-time hand tracking to move the mouse cursor and perform left and right clicks based on specific finger gestures.

## Features

-  Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
-  Move the mouse using just the index finger tip
-  Left-click when all five fingers are raised (open palm)
-  Right-click when only the thumb is raised (thumbs-up gesture)
